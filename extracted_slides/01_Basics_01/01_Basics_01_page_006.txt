转化流程 (Conversion Flow) - Highlighted Version

This slide shows the same conversion funnel as the previous slide, but with all elements highlighted in red boxes to emphasize the complete user journey:

Highlighted User Engagement Flow:

Starting Point (Red Box):
- 曝光 (Impression) → 点击 (Click)

Post-Click Actions (All in Red Boxes):
1. 滑动到底 (ScrollToEnd) → 评论 (Comment)
2. 点赞 (Like)
3. 收藏 (Collect)  
4. 转发 (Share)

Key Emphasis Points:
The red highlighting indicates that all these conversion steps are critical metrics for recommendation systems:

- Initial funnel: Impression → Click represents the basic conversion from content visibility to user interest
- Deep engagement: ScrollToEnd → Comment shows users who fully consume content and provide feedback
- Quick actions: Like, Collect, Share represent immediate positive signals that can be captured without extensive content consumption

System Implications:
This highlighted view suggests that recommendation systems should:
- Track and optimize for each highlighted conversion step
- Weight different actions appropriately (comments may indicate deeper engagement than likes)
- Use all these signals as training data for improving future recommendations
- Monitor conversion rates at each step to identify optimization opportunities

The comprehensive highlighting emphasizes that every step in this flow provides valuable user preference data for the recommendation algorithm.
