消费指标 (Consumption Metrics)

This slide defines key performance metrics used in recommendation systems to measure user engagement and content consumption:

Key Metrics Formulas:

• 点击率 = 点击次数 / 曝光次数
  (Click-Through Rate = Number of Clicks / Number of Impressions)

• 点赞率 = 点赞次数 / 点击次数  
  (Like Rate = Number of Likes / Number of Clicks)

• 收藏率 = 收藏次数 / 点击次数
  (Collection Rate = Number of Collections / Number of Clicks)

• 转发率 = 转发次数 / 点击次数
  (Share Rate = Number of Shares / Number of Clicks)

• 阅读完成率 = 滑动到底次数 / 点击次数 × f(笔记长度)
  (Reading Completion Rate = Number of ScrollToEnd / Number of Clicks × f(Note Length))

Important Notes:
- All engagement metrics (like, collection, share rates) are calculated relative to clicks, not impressions
- The reading completion rate includes a function f(笔记长度) that accounts for content length, suggesting longer content may have different completion rate calculations
- The f(笔记长度) factor (highlighted in red) indicates that content length is an important variable in measuring true reading completion

These metrics help recommendation systems:
1. Measure content quality and user engagement depth
2. Compare performance across different content types and lengths  
3. Optimize ranking algorithms based on these conversion rates
4. Identify high-performing content patterns for better recommendations
