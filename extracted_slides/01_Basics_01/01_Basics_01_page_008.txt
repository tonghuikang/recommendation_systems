北极星指标 (North Star Metrics)

This slide outlines the key North Star metrics that recommendation systems focus on to measure overall platform success:

• 用户规模 (User Scale):
  • 日活用户数 (DAU) - Daily Active Users
  • 月活用户数 (MAU) - Monthly Active Users

• 消费 (Consumption):
  • 人均使用推荐的时长 - Average time spent using recommendations per user
  • 人均阅读笔记的数量 - Average number of notes read per user

• 发布 (Publishing):
  • 发布渗透率 - Publishing penetration rate
  • 人均发布量 - Average publishing volume per user

Key Insights:
1. User Scale Metrics: Focus on both daily and monthly active users to measure platform growth and stickiness

2. Consumption Metrics: Track how much time users spend with recommended content and how many pieces of content they consume, indicating recommendation system effectiveness

3. Publishing Metrics: Monitor what percentage of users create content (penetration rate) and how much content each user creates on average, which feeds back into the recommendation ecosystem

These North Star metrics help guide the overall strategy of recommendation systems by:
- Measuring platform health and growth (user scale)
- Evaluating recommendation quality and engagement (consumption)
- Ensuring content supply for the recommendation engine (publishing)

The balance between these three categories is crucial for a sustainable recommendation platform ecosystem.
