实验流程 (Experimentation Process)

This slide illustrates the three-phase process for implementing and testing recommendation system improvements:

Three-Phase Process:

1. 离线实验 (Offline Experiments)
   收集历史数据，在历史数据上做训练、测试。算法没有部署到产品中，没有跟用户交互。
   (Collect historical data, conduct training and testing on historical data. The algorithm is not deployed to the product and has no user interaction.)

2. 小流量AB测试 (Small-Scale A/B Testing)  
   把算法部署到实际产品中，用户实际跟算法做交互。
   (Deploy the algorithm to the actual product, with users actually interacting with the algorithm.)

3. 全流量上线 (Full-Scale Launch)
   (Complete rollout to all traffic)

Process Flow Logic:
- Stage 1 (Offline): Safe testing environment using historical data, no real user impact
- Stage 2 (Small A/B): Limited real-world testing with actual users to validate performance
- Stage 3 (Full Launch): Complete deployment after successful validation

Key Characteristics:
- **Offline Experiments**: Risk-free testing, uses past data, no user interaction
- **Small A/B Testing**: Real user feedback, controlled exposure, actual algorithmic interaction  
- **Full Launch**: Complete implementation across entire user base

This staged approach allows recommendation systems to:
- Validate improvements without user risk (offline)
- Test real-world performance on limited scale (A/B)
- Deploy confidently to full user base (launch)

The progression ensures both safety and effectiveness in recommendation system deployment.
