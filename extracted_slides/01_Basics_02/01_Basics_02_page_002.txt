推荐系统的链路 (Recommendation System Pipeline)

This slide introduces the multi-stage recommendation system pipeline, showing the flow from initial content pool to final user recommendations:

Pipeline Flow:
几亿物品 → 召回 → 几千物品 → 粗排 → 几百物品 → 精排 → 几百物品 → 重排 → 几十物品

Stage-by-Stage Breakdown:
1. 几亿物品 (Hundreds of millions of items) - Initial content pool
2. 召回 (Recall/Retrieval) - First filtering stage
3. 几千物品 (Thousands of items) - After recall filtering  
4. 粗排 (Coarse Ranking) - Initial ranking stage
5. 几百物品 (Hundreds of items) - After coarse ranking
6. 精排 (Fine Ranking) - Detailed ranking stage  
7. 几百物品 (Hundreds of items) - After fine ranking
8. 重排 (Re-ranking) - Final optimization stage
9. 几十物品 (Tens of items) - Final recommendations shown to user

Key Insights:
- Massive scale reduction: From hundreds of millions to tens of items
- Multi-stage filtering and ranking approach for computational efficiency
- Each stage progressively refines the selection with more sophisticated but computationally expensive algorithms
- The funnel structure balances recommendation quality with system performance
