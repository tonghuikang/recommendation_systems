推荐系统的链路 (Recommendation System Pipeline) - Highlighted Recall

This slide shows the same recommendation pipeline with the 召回 (Recall/Retrieval) stage highlighted, emphasizing its role in the system:

Pipeline Flow with Recall Emphasis:
几亿物品 → **召回** → 几千物品 → 粗排 → 几百物品 → 精排 → 几百物品 → 重排 → 几十物品

Highlighted Stage:
- **召回 (Recall/Retrieval)**: The first critical filtering stage that reduces hundreds of millions of items to thousands

Key Points about Recall Stage:
- First major bottleneck in the recommendation pipeline
- Must be highly efficient to handle massive scale (hundreds of millions of items)
- Responsible for the largest reduction in candidate items
- Sets the foundation for all subsequent ranking stages
- Typically uses simpler, faster algorithms (collaborative filtering, content-based matching, etc.)
- Cannot recover items that are filtered out at this stage, making recall completeness crucial

The highlighting suggests this stage is being focused on in the current presentation, likely due to its fundamental importance in the recommendation system architecture.
