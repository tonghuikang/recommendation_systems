推荐系统的链路 (Recommendation System Pipeline) - Highlighted Coarse Ranking

This slide shows the same recommendation pipeline with the 粗排 (Coarse Ranking) stage highlighted, emphasizing its role in the system:

Pipeline Flow with Coarse Ranking Emphasis:
几亿物品 → 召回 → 几千物品 → **粗排** → 几百物品 → 精排 → 几百物品 → 重排 → 几十物品

Highlighted Stage:
- **粗排 (Coarse Ranking)**: The second major filtering and ranking stage that reduces thousands of items to hundreds

Key Points about Coarse Ranking Stage:
- Operates on the output of the recall stage (thousands of items)
- Provides the first level of ranking/scoring for candidate items
- Still needs to be computationally efficient to handle thousands of items
- Uses simpler ranking models compared to fine ranking
- Further narrows down the candidate set for more expensive fine ranking algorithms
- Balances between computational cost and ranking quality

The highlighting indicates this stage is the current focus, showing its position as an intermediate step between initial recall and detailed fine ranking in the recommendation pipeline.
