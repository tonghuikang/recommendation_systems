推荐系统的链路 (Recommendation System Pipeline) - Highlighted Re-ranking

This slide shows the same recommendation pipeline with the 重排 (Re-ranking) stage highlighted, emphasizing its role in the system:

Pipeline Flow with Re-ranking Emphasis:
几亿物品 → 召回 → 几千物品 → 粗排 → 几百物品 → 精排 → 几百物品 → **重排** → 几十物品

Highlighted Stage:
- **重排 (Re-ranking)**: The final optimization stage that produces the ultimate recommendations shown to users

Key Points about Re-ranking Stage:
- Final stage in the recommendation pipeline
- Operates on the smallest set (transitioning from hundreds to tens of items)
- Applies business logic, diversity constraints, and final optimizations
- Considers factors beyond individual item relevance (e.g., overall feed diversity, freshness, business objectives)
- May apply deduplication, content policy filters, and user experience optimizations
- Responsible for the final user-facing recommendation quality
- Often incorporates real-time contextual factors and A/B testing logic

The highlighting emphasizes this as the final critical step that determines what users actually see in their feeds.
