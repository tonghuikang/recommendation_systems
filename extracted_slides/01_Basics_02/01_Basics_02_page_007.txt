(Recall Channels: Collaborative Filtering, Two-Tower Model, Followed Authors, etc.)

This slide introduces the concept of recall channels and shows a visual representation of the massive item pool:

Header Information:
召回通道 (Recall Channels) includes:
- 协同过滤 (Collaborative Filtering)
- 双塔模型 (Two-Tower Model)  
- 关注的作者 (Followed Authors)
- 等等 (And others)

Visual Element:
- Large green cylindrical database/storage representation labeled “几亿” (hundreds of millions)
- This represents the massive scale of the initial content pool that recall systems must process

Key Insights:
- Multiple recall channels work in parallel to retrieve relevant content
- Each channel uses different algorithms and signals:
  - Collaborative Filtering: Based on user behavior patterns
  - Two-Tower Model: Deep learning approach for user-item matching
  - Followed Authors: Content from users the person follows
- The scale challenge: Processing hundreds of millions of items efficiently
- Different channels capture different aspects of user preferences

This slide sets up the technical foundation for understanding how recall systems handle massive scale through diverse algorithmic approaches.
