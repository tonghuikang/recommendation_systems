召回通道组合 (Recall Channel Combination)

This slide shows how multiple recall channels work in parallel to retrieve candidates from the massive item pool:

Architecture Diagram:
- **几亿** (Hundreds of millions) - Initial massive item database
- **召回通道#1** → **几百** (Hundreds) - First recall channel output
- **召回通道#2** → **几百** (Hundreds) - Second recall channel output
- **•••** (Dots indicating more channels)
- **召回通道#10** → **几百** (Hundreds) - Tenth recall channel output

Key Concepts:
1. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple recall channels operate simultaneously
2. **Channel Diversity**: Each channel (1, 2, ... 10) uses different algorithms
3. **Scale Reduction**: Each channel reduces millions/billions to hundreds of candidates
4. **Channel Specialization**: Different channels capture different user preferences
   - Channel #1-10 might represent different algorithms or user interest areas

System Benefits:
- **Coverage**: Multiple channels ensure comprehensive candidate retrieval
- **Efficiency**: Each channel handles a portion of the recommendation space
- **Robustness**: Redundancy across channels improves system reliability
