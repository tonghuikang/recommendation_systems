召回通道合并与排序 (Recall Channel Merging and Ranking)

This slide shows the progression from multiple recall channels to the ranking stages:

Header:
排序: [几千] → 粗排 → [几百] → 精排 → [几百]
(Ranking: [Thousands] → Coarse Ranking → [Hundreds] → Fine Ranking → [Hundreds])

Architecture Flow:
- **几亿** (Hundreds of millions) - Initial item database
- **召回通道#1** → **几百** (Hundreds) - First recall channel
- **召回通道#2** → **几百** (Hundreds) - Second recall channel  
- **召回通道#10** → **几百** (Hundreds) - Tenth recall channel
- **粗排、精排** → **几百** (Hundreds) - Combined ranking stages

Key Process:
1. **Channel Merging**: Results from all recall channels (typically 10+ channels) are combined
2. **Deduplication**: Remove duplicate items retrieved by multiple channels
3. **Initial Aggregation**: Combine hundreds of items from each channel into thousands total
4. **Ranking Pipeline Entry**: The merged thousands of items enter the ranking system
5. **Two-Stage Ranking**: 
   - Coarse ranking reduces thousands to hundreds
   - Fine ranking optimizes the hundreds for final quality

Technical Considerations:
- **Union Operation**: Combine results from all parallel recall channels
- **Diversity Preservation**: Ensure each channel contributes to final candidates
- **Ranking Preparation**: Aggregate features and metadata for ranking algorithms
- **Scale Management**: Manage the transition from parallel processing to sequential ranking
