用户对物品的兴趣：
like(user, item_i)

物品之间的相似度：
sim(item_j, item)

[Diagram showing user-item interactions with similarity scores]
- User (represented by user icon with laptop)
- Arrows pointing to different items (video icons) labeled with numbers: 2, 1, 4, 3
- Items are labeled as "用户交互过的物品" (Items the user has interacted with)
- Dashed arrows pointing from the interacted items to a yellow candidate item showing similarity scores: 0.1, 0.4, 0.2, 0.6
- Yellow item labeled "Item" (candidate item for recommendation)

预估用户对候选物品的兴趣：∑_j like(user, item_j) × sim(item_j, item)

[Visual elements: Mathematical formula shown in red box at bottom of slide, representing the calculation for predicting user interest in candidate item]
