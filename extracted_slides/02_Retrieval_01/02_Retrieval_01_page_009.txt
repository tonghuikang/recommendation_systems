用户对物品的兴趣：
like(user, item_i)

物品之间的相似度：
sim(item_j, item)

[Diagram showing user-item interactions with similarity scores and red highlighting]
- User (represented by user icon with laptop)
- Red arrows pointing to different items (video icons) labeled with numbers: 2, 1, 4, 3
- Items are labeled as "用户交互过的物品" (Items the user has interacted with)
- Red dashed arrows pointing from the interacted items to a yellow candidate item showing similarity scores: 0.1, 0.4, 0.2, 0.6
- Yellow item labeled "Item" (candidate item for recommendation)

预估用户对候选物品的兴趣：2×0.1 + 1×0.4 + 4×0.2 + 3×0.6 = 3.2

[Visual elements: Same diagram as previous slide but with red highlighting of all arrows and the calculation result shown in red box at bottom]
