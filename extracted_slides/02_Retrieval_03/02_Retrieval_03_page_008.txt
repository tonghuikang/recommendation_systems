用户之间的相似度：
sim(user, userj)

用户对物品的兴趣：
like(useri, item)

预估用户对候选物品的兴趣：0.9×0 + 0.7×1 + 0.7×3 + 0.4×0 = 2.8

Diagram Description:
This slide provides a concrete numerical example of the collaborative filtering calculation. The formula from the previous slide is now calculated with actual values:

0.9×0 + 0.7×1 + 0.7×3 + 0.4×0 = 2.8

This demonstrates:
- User with similarity 0.9 has interest 0 in the item
- User with similarity 0.7 has interest 1 in the item  
- User with similarity 0.7 has interest 3 in the item
- User with similarity 0.4 has interest 0 in the item

The final predicted interest score is 2.8, shown with red underlining to emphasize the result.
