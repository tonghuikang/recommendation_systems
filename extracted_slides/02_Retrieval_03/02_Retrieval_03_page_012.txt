计算用户相似度

• 用户 u1 喜欢的物品记作集合 J1。
• 用户 u2 喜欢的物品记作集合 J2。  
• 定义交集 I = J1 ∩ J2。

Content Description:
This slide introduces the mathematical framework for calculating user similarity. It defines:

1. J1: The set of items that user u1 likes
2. J2: The set of items that user u2 likes
3. I: The intersection set I = J1 ∩ J2 (items liked by both users)

This sets up the foundation for similarity calculation by identifying shared preferences between users through set intersection.
