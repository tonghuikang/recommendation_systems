Summary Content:
This slide presents a summary (小结) of the basic concept of User-based Collaborative Filtering (UserCF):

The fundamental idea of UserCF:
- If user1 is similar to user2, and user2 likes a certain item,
- Then user1 is very likely to also like that item.

This captures the core assumption behind user-based collaborative filtering - that similar users will have similar preferences.
