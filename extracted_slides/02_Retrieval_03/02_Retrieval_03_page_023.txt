This slide illustrates the "User → Item" index structure with concrete examples:

Two users are shown:
1. First user (person with laptop): Has a list of items with interest scores:
   - Red video item: score 2
   - Black video item: score 1  
   - Blue video item: score 4
   - Orange video item: score 3
   - ... (indicating more items)

2. Second user (woman): Has a different list of items with interest scores:
   - Brown video item: score 3
   - Green video item: score 1
   - Black video item: score 1
   - Light blue video item: score 1
   - ... (indicating more items)

The dots at the bottom indicate there are more users in the system. This demonstrates how each user maps to their personalized list of items with corresponding interest scores.
