“用户→用户”的索引

用户：

Diagram Description:
This slide introduces the "User → User" index structure. The title shows this will map each user to other similar users.

The slide shows:
- A header indicating this is about user-to-user indexing
- Two user avatars are displayed:
  1. A man with glasses and brown clothing
  2. A woman with red/pink hair
- Dots at the bottom indicate there are more users in the system

This sets up the concept that each user will be mapped to their most similar users, which is essential for collaborative filtering recommendations.
