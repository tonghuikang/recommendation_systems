Top-k 相似的用户（ID，相似度）

Diagram Description:
This slide illustrates step 1 of the online recall process with a concrete example.

The diagram shows:
- A target user (person with laptop on left)
- An arrow pointing to their top-k most similar users
- The top-5 similar users are displayed in a table format with their IDs and similarity scores:
  - Businessman: 0.7
  - Man with glasses and teal sweater: 0.6  
  - Business person with tie: 0.6
  - Person in light blue: 0.3
  - Person in dark blue: 0.3

This demonstrates the first step where the system retrieves the most similar users to the target user for recommendation generation.
