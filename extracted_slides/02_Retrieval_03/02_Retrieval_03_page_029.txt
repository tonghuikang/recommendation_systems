Diagram Description:
This slide builds on the previous one by showing step 2 of the online recall process.

The diagram shows:
- The same target user and their top-k similar users from the previous slide
- An arrow pointing down from the first similar user (businessman with 0.7 similarity)
- A small table showing the user's interested items:
  - Red video item: score 1
  - Brown video item: score 3

This demonstrates step 2 where for each similar user, the system retrieves their recently interested items (last-n) to use for generating recommendations for the target user.
