Diagram Description:
This slide shows the expanded view of step 2 in the online recall process.

The diagram illustrates:
- The target user and their top-5 similar users (same as previous slides)
- Arrows pointing down from each similar user to their interested items
- Each of the 5 similar users has 2 items with interest scores:
  
User 1 (0.7 similarity): Red video (1), Brown video (3)
User 2 (0.6 similarity): Grey video (4), Orange video (1)  
User 3 (0.6 similarity): Yellow/green video (3), Dark video (3)
User 4 (0.3 similarity): Orange video (1), Green video (2)
User 5 (0.3 similarity): Red video (4), Blue video (4)

This demonstrates how the system collects interested items from all similar users to create a candidate pool for recommendation.
