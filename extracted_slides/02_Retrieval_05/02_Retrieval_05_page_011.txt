A sparse user-item rating matrix with the following characteristics:

### Matrix Structure:
- **每行对应一个用户** (Each row corresponds to one user)
- **每列对应一个物品** (Each column corresponds to one item)

### Rating Values:
The matrix contains various integer ratings from 0 to 4:
- Values include: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- Most cells are empty (sparse matrix)
- Green cells contain observed ratings
- Gray cells represent unobserved interactions

### Sample Data Points:
- Multiple entries of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 distributed across the matrix
- Sparse structure with many missing values
- Each non-empty cell represents a user-item interaction with its corresponding rating
