# User Query Vector in Embedding Space

## Vector Space with User Query

This visualization shows the same 2D embedding space with the addition of:

### New Element:
- **Black star (â˜…a)**: User embedding vector representing the query user's preferences
- Located in the lower-right quadrant of the coordinate system

### Spatial Analysis:
- User vector **a** is positioned among various item embeddings
- Proximity to different colored clusters indicates potential user interests
- Items closer to the user vector **a** are more likely to be relevant recommendations

### Recommendation Strategy:
- Calculate similarity between user vector **a** and all item vectors (colored dots)
- Items with shortest distance or highest similarity to **a** become top recommendations
- The visual proximity in this 2D space represents the mathematical similarity in the full embedding space

### Use Case:
- This represents the first step in the online serving process
- After retrieving user embedding **a**, the system searches for nearest item neighbors
- The spatial arrangement guides the approximate nearest neighbor search
