# Angular Partitioning for Approximate Search

## Partitioning Strategy

This visualization demonstrates an angular partitioning approach for efficient nearest neighbor search:

### Partitioning Method:
- **Circular division**: The 2D space is divided into angular sectors/wedges
- **Multi-colored regions**: Each sector represents a partition in the search index
- **Radial lines**: Two diagonal arrows (orange and blue) show the partitioning boundaries

### Color-coded Sectors:
- **Yellow/Green sectors**: Upper quadrants
- **Blue/Cyan sectors**: Left quadrants  
- **Pink/Red sectors**: Lower-right quadrants
- **Orange sectors**: Right quadrants

### Search Optimization:
- Items are pre-grouped by angular position
- For a query vector, only relevant sectors need to be searched
- This reduces computational complexity from O(n) to O(n/k) where k is number of partitions

### Technical Implementation:
- Each item embedding is assigned to a sector based on its angular position
- Query processing focuses on the most relevant sectors first
- This is a form of approximate nearest neighbor search used in systems like LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing)
