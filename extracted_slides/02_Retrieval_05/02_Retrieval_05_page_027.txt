# Multi-directional Angular Partitioning

## Enhanced Partitioning Scheme

This shows a more complex angular partitioning system:

### Directional Vectors:
- **Multiple colored arrows** radiating from the center origin
- **Green arrows**: Upper-left directions (3 arrows)
- **Orange arrows**: Right direction (2 arrows)
- **Blue arrow**: Lower-left direction
- **Purple arrow**: Lower direction
- **Red arrow**: Lower-right direction
- **Cyan arrow**: Left direction

### Advanced Search Strategy:
- **Multi-directional search**: Query can be matched against multiple relevant directions
- **Hierarchical partitioning**: Different angular granularities for different regions
- **Adaptive search**: System can choose optimal directions based on query characteristics

### Implementation Benefits:
- More precise partitioning than simple radial division
- Better handling of query vectors that fall between major partitions
- Improved approximation quality while maintaining efficiency
- Can be adapted for different embedding space densities

### Use in Practice:
- This type of partitioning is used in advanced ANN systems
- Helps balance search accuracy with computational efficiency
- Particularly useful for high-dimensional embedding spaces
