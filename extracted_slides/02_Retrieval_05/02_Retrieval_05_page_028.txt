# Query Vector with Directional Search Paths

## User Query in Multi-directional System

This visualization combines the user query vector with the directional partitioning system:

### Key Elements:
- **Black star (â˜…a)**: User query vector positioned in the lower-right area
- **Colored directional arrows**: Multiple search directions from the origin
- **Spatial relationship**: Query vector **a** is positioned relative to the directional grid

### Search Process:
1. **Query vector identification**: User embedding **a** is located in the space
2. **Direction matching**: System identifies which directional arrows are most relevant to **a**
3. **Focused search**: Items along relevant directions are prioritized for similarity computation

### Relevant Directions for Query **a**:
- **Orange arrows** (right direction): High relevance due to proximity
- **Red arrow** (lower-right): Direct alignment with query position
- **Purple arrow** (lower): Secondary relevance

### Efficiency Gains:
- Instead of computing similarity with all items, focus on items in relevant directions
- Significant reduction in computational load
- Maintains high-quality recommendations by targeting the most promising search directions

### Practical Implementation:
- This represents how modern ANN systems optimize user queries
- Combines spatial indexing with directional search strategies
