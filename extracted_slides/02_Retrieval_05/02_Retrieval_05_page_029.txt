# Focused Search Region

## Angular Sector Search with Query

This demonstrates the focused search approach:

### Key Elements:
- **Light orange/pink sector**: Highlighted search region
- **Orange arrow**: Primary search direction
- **Black star (â˜…a)**: User query vector
- **Colored dots**: Item embeddings within the search sector

### Items in Search Region:
- **Orange dots**: Items closely aligned with search direction
- **Red dots**: Items in the sector but with different characteristics
- **Pink dots**: Items at sector boundaries

### Search Strategy:
1. **Sector identification**: Query vector **a** determines the relevant angular sector
2. **Focused computation**: Only items within the highlighted sector are considered
3. **Efficient processing**: Dramatically reduces computational load compared to exhaustive search

### Performance Benefits:
- **Reduced complexity**: From O(n) to O(n/k) where k is number of sectors
- **Maintained accuracy**: Items in relevant sectors are most likely to be good recommendations
- **Scalable approach**: Works well with large item catalogs

### Practical Implementation:
- This sector-based approach is commonly used in production recommendation systems
- Balances recommendation quality with computational efficiency
