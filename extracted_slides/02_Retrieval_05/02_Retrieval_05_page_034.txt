## Summary:
This concludes the presentation on Matrix Completion for recommendation systems. The presentation covered:

- **Basic concepts** of matrix completion approach
- **Training methodology** using embedding layers
- **Practical limitations** and why it performs poorly in practice
- **Online serving** challenges and solutions
- **Approximate nearest neighbor search** techniques
- **Vector database systems** for efficient retrieval

### Key Takeaway:
While Matrix Completion provides a foundational understanding of embedding-based recommendation systems, its practical limitations have led to the development of more sophisticated approaches like two-tower models and other advanced architectures.

### Next Steps:
This material serves as preparation for understanding more advanced recommendation system architectures that address the limitations identified in this basic matrix completion approach.
