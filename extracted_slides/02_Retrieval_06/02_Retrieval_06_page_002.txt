# 矩阵补充模型 (Matrix Completion Model)

## 架构图示：
1. **内积 (Inner Product)**: (a, b)
   - Position: Top center with purple node

2. **User Side (Left)**:
   - Blue embedding vector **a**
   - Embedding Layer (灰色方框)
   - Blue circle: 用户ID (User ID)

3. **Item Side (Right)**:
   - Red embedding vector **b**
   - Embedding Layer (灰色方框)
   - Red circle: 物品ID (Item ID)

## 流程说明：
- User ID and Item ID are processed through separate embedding layers
- Each produces an embedding vector (a for user, b for item)
- The vectors are combined using inner product to produce the final result (a, b)
- Arrows indicate the flow from IDs through embedding layers to final computation

This represents the basic matrix completion approach that serves as a foundation for understanding the two-tower model.
