# Complete User Tower Architecture

## User Feature Processing:

### Feature Concatenation:
- All user feature embeddings are concatenated together
- **Concatenate** operation combines multiple feature vectors

### Neural Network Processing:
- **神经网络 (Neural Network)** processes the concatenated features
- Transforms raw features into meaningful representations

### Final Output:
- **用户的表征 (User Representation)** - Final user embedding vector

## Input Features:
1. **用户ID (User ID)**:
   - Processed through Embedding Layer
   - Generates user-specific representation

2. **用户离散特征 (User Discrete Features)**:
   - Categorical features (e.g., age group, gender, location)
   - Processed through multiple Embedding Layers

3. **用户连续特征 (User Continuous Features)**:
   - Numerical features (e.g., activity scores, engagement metrics)
   - Processed through 归一化、分箱等处理 (Normalization, Binning, etc.)

## Architecture Benefits:
- **Multi-modal fusion**: Combines different types of user information
- **Deep learning**: Neural network learns complex feature interactions
- **Scalable processing**: Handles various user feature types efficiently
