用户特征 x → 神经网络 → softmax → p₁ (选择) → a

[Diagram showing neural network architecture with:
- Input: user features x (shown as stacked bars)
- Neural network processing
- Softmax layer
- Output probability distribution p₁
- Selection of node a
- Below shows tree structure with levels L1, L2, L3 containing nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., K]
