用户特征 x → 神经网络 → softmax → p₁ (选择) → a

[Top path with red arrow showing embedding connection]

x ⊕ emb(a) → 神经网络 → softmax → p₂ (选择) → b

[Diagram showing:
- User features x combined with embedding of selected node a
- Neural network processing 
- Softmax layer
- Output probability distribution p₂
- Selection of node b
- Red arrow labeled "embedding" connecting selected node a to the embedding input]
