Multi-Task Learning - Weighted Combination

This slide illustrates the weighted combination process in multi-task learning:

**Mathematical Formula:**
p₁x₁ + p₂x₂ + p₃x₃

**Process Description:**
- 对向量做加权平均 (Weighted average of vectors)
- The three intermediate representations (x₁, x₂, x₃) are combined using their respective weights (p₁, p₂, p₃)

**Architecture Flow:**
1. Input weights: [p₁, p₂, p₃] labeled as 权重 (Weights)
2. Intermediate representations: x₁, x₂, x₃ (purple vectors)
3. Weighted combination: Creates final representation (orange vector)
4. Output weights: [q₁, q₂, q₃] labeled as 权重 (Weights)

**Key Concept:**
- This demonstrates how multi-task learning creates task-specific representations through weighted averaging
- The weights determine the contribution of each intermediate representation to the final output
- Different tasks can have different weight distributions, allowing specialization while sharing underlying representations
