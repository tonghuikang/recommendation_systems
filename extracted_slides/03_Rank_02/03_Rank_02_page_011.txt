Polarization Phenomenon

**Title:** 极化现象 (Polarization)

**Key Concept:**
This slide introduces the concept of polarization in recommendation systems, which is a critical issue that can arise in ranking and recommendation algorithms.

**Polarization in Recommendation Systems:**
- **Definition:** The tendency of recommendation systems to amplify extreme preferences or create echo chambers
- **Manifestation:** Users may receive increasingly similar or extreme recommendations based on their past behavior
- **Impact:** Can lead to reduced content diversity and reinforced biases

**Relevance to Multi-Task Learning:**
- In the context of the previous multi-task architecture (CTR and Like Rate prediction)
- Polarization can affect both tasks differently
- Multi-task learning may help mitigate polarization by considering multiple objectives simultaneously

**Why This Matters:**
- Recommendation systems need to balance engagement metrics with content diversity
- Understanding polarization is crucial for building fair and diverse recommendation systems
- Proper handling of polarization ensures better user experience and platform health
