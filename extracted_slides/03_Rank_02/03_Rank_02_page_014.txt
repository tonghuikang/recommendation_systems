Polarization Example - Right Task Focus

**Definition:**
极化(polarize): Softmax输出值一个接近1，其余接近0。
(Polarization: Softmax output values where one approaches 1, others approach 0.)

**Example Demonstration:**
- **Left Task (Orange Branch):** Maintains polarized weights [0, 0, 1]
  - Still focusing only on x₃ representation

- **Right Task (Green Branch):** Shows polarized weights [0, 1, 0] 
  - Only the second representation (x₂) receives full attention (weight = 1)
  - The first and third representations (x₁, x₃) are completely ignored (weight = 0)
  - Highlighted by blue box around the x₂ pathway and output

**Key Observations:**
1. **Different Polarization Patterns:** Each task polarizes to different representations
2. **Complete Specialization:** Each task uses only one out of three available representations
3. **Loss of Shared Learning:** The tasks don't benefit from each other's learned features
4. **Wasted Capacity:** Two-thirds of the learned representations are unused by each task

**Problems This Creates:**
- **Brittleness:** Model performance depends entirely on single representations
- **Limited Transfer Learning:** Tasks cannot share useful information
- **Inefficient Architecture:** Multi-task setup provides no advantage over separate models
- **Potential Overfitting:** Over-specialization on specific feature patterns
