Polarization and Dead Neurons

**Definition:**
极化(polarize): Softmax输出值一个接近1，其余接近0。
(Polarization: Softmax output values where one approaches 1, others approach 0.)

**Dead Neuron Problem:**
- **Left Task:** Shows weights [0, 0, 1] - first neural network marked as "dead"
- **Right Task:** Shows weights [0, 1, 0] - continues to use only x₂

**Visual Indicators:**
- **Red Box:** Highlights the "dead" neural network (第1号神经网络)
- **Blue Box:** Shows the active pathways (x₂ and x₃)
- The word "dead" explicitly marks the unused neural network pathway

**Consequences of Dead Neurons:**
1. **Wasted Computational Resources:** Neural networks that receive zero attention become unused
2. **Reduced Model Capacity:** Effective model size decreases as neurons become inactive
3. **Training Inefficiency:** Gradients stop flowing through dead pathways
4. **Loss of Diversity:** Model loses the ability to learn different feature representations

**Multi-Task Impact:**
- Different tasks may kill different neural pathways
- This creates an unbalanced architecture where some parts are overused while others are ignored
- The shared learning benefit of multi-task architecture is severely compromised
- Model becomes equivalent to multiple smaller, specialized single-task models
