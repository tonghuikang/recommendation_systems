Fusion of Predictive Scores - Simple Weighted Sum

**Title:** 融合预估分数 (Fusion of Predictive Scores)

**Method 1: Simple Weighted Sum**
简单的加权和 (Simple Weighted Sum)

**Formula:**
p_click + w₁ · p_like + w₂ · p_collect + ...

**Components:**
- **p_click:** Click-through rate probability (highlighted in blue)
- **p_like:** Like probability (highlighted in blue)
- **p_collect:** Collection/Save probability
- **w₁, w₂, ...:** Weight parameters for different actions
- **"...":** Additional user actions and their probabilities

**Characteristics:**
- **Simplicity:** Direct linear combination of different probability scores
- **Interpretability:** Easy to understand and explain
- **Baseline Method:** Often used as a starting point for more complex fusion approaches
- **Weight Optimization:** Weights can be learned through training or set based on business priorities

**Use Cases:**
- Multi-objective recommendation systems
- Combining engagement signals (clicks, likes, shares, etc.)
- Business-driven score combination where different actions have different values
