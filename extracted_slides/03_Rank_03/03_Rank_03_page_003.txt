Fusion with Click-Through Rate Weighting

**Title:** 融合预估分数 (Fusion of Predictive Scores)

**Method 1: Simple Weighted Sum**
简单的加权和 (Simple Weighted Sum)
p_click + w₁ · p_like + w₂ · p_collect + ...

**Method 2: CTR-Weighted Combination**
点击率乘以其他项的加权和 (Click-through rate multiplied by weighted sum of other items)

**Formula (highlighted in blue box):**
p_click · (1 + w₁ · p_like + w₂ · p_collect + ...)

**Key Differences:**
1. **Multiplicative Structure:** CTR acts as a gating mechanism
2. **Base Score:** Click probability serves as the foundation score
3. **Enhancement Factor:** Other actions provide multiplicative boosts
4. **Interaction Effects:** Non-linear combination creates interaction between different prediction scores

**Mathematical Interpretation:**
- If p_click is low, the overall score remains low regardless of other factors
- High p_click allows other positive signals (likes, collections) to amplify the final score
- The "(1 + ...)" structure ensures the base CTR is never diminished

**Practical Benefits:**
- **Business Logic:** Aligns with the intuition that items must first be clicked to generate other engagements
- **Filtering Effect:** Naturally downweights items with very low click probability
- **Amplification:** Allows high-engagement items to rise in rankings
