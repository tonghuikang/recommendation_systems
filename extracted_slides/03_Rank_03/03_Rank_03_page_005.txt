International Short Video App Scoring Formula

**Title:** 融合预估分数 (Fusion of Predictive Scores)

**Case Study:** 海外某短视频APP的融分公式
(Scoring formula from an international short video app)

**Advanced Fusion Formula:**
(1 + w₁ · p_time)^α₁ · (1 + w₂ · p_like)^α₂ ...

**Components (highlighted in blue):**
- **(1 + w₁ · p_time)^α₁:** Watch time component with exponential weighting
- **(1 + w₂ · p_like)^α₂:** Like probability component with exponential weighting
- **"...":** Additional engagement factors

**Key Features:**
1. **Multiplicative Structure:** All components multiply together
2. **Exponential Weighting:** Each component raised to power αᵢ
3. **Non-linear Interactions:** Creates complex interactions between different signals
4. **Flexible Tuning:** Both wᵢ (linear weights) and αᵢ (exponential weights) are tunable

**Mathematical Properties:**
- **Base Value:** Each term starts with 1, ensuring no component can make the score negative
- **Amplification:** High values in any component can significantly boost the overall score
- **Compound Effects:** Multiple high-performing components create multiplicative benefits
- **Sensitivity Control:** α parameters control how much each component influences the final score

**Practical Benefits:**
- **Rich Interaction Modeling:** Captures complex relationships between engagement signals
- **Industry-Proven:** Based on real-world implementation from successful short video platform
- **Flexible Optimization:** Multiple parameters allow fine-tuning for different business objectives
