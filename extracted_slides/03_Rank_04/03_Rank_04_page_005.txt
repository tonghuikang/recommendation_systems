Neural Network Architecture with Mathematical Formulations:

Same neural network diagram as previous page, but with added mathematical components:

y = t/(1+t) (shown with blue dot)

CE(y, p) = y · log p + (1 - y) · log(1 - p) (Cross-entropy loss function)

p = exp(z)/(1+exp(z)) (Sigmoid function, shown with green dot)

The diagram shows:
- Multiple fully connected layers (全连接层) feeding into neural network (神经网络)
- Output z (red dot) 
- Feature types at bottom: 用户特征 (User Features), 视频特征 (Video Features), 统计特征 (Statistical Features), 场景特征 (Context Features)
- Mathematical relationships between t (watch time), y (normalized watch time), z (network output), and p (predicted probability)
