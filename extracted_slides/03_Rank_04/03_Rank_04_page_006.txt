Neural Network Architecture with Mathematical Relationship:

Same neural network diagram as previous pages, with highlighted mathematical relationship:

y = t/(1+t) (shown with blue dot)

如果 p = y，那么 exp(z) = t。(If p = y, then exp(z) = t.)

p = exp(z)/(1+exp(z)) (Sigmoid function, shown with green dot)

The diagram shows:
- Multiple fully connected layers (全连接层) feeding into neural network (神经网络)  
- Output z (red dot)
- Feature types at bottom: 用户特征 (User Features), 视频特征 (Video Features), 统计特征 (Statistical Features), 场景特征 (Context Features)

Key mathematical insight: When prediction p equals the normalized watch time y, then exp(z) = t (actual watch time).
