Neural Network Usage Framework:

Same neural network architecture diagram with two usage scenarios highlighted:

用作推理，          用作训练
预估时长 t          (For inference,     For training
                    predict duration t)

exp(z) ← (blue dot)     p = exp(z)/(1+exp(z)) ← (green dot)

The diagram shows:
- Multiple fully connected layers (全连接层) feeding into neural network (神经网络)
- Output z (red dot) 
- Feature types at bottom: 用户特征 (User Features), 视频特征 (Video Features), 统计特征 (Statistical Features), 场景特征 (Context Features)

Two modes of operation:
1. For inference: Use exp(z) to predict watch time t
2. For training: Use sigmoid function p = exp(z)/(1+exp(z))
