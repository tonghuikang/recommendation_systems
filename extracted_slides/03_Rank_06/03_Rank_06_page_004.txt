Multi-task learning architecture with shared bottom:

Four output heads:
- 点击率 (Click-through Rate)
- 点赞率 (Like Rate) 
- 收藏率 (Save Rate)
- 转发率 (Share Rate)

Each head has: 全连接层+Sigmoid

Shared neural network backbone labeled as:
神经网络 (shared bottom)

Input features (concatenated):
- 用户特征 (User Features) - shown in blue
- 物品特征 (Item Features) - shown in red  
- 统计特征 (Statistical Features) - shown in green
- 场景特征 (Context Features) - shown in orange

The features are concatenated and fed into the shared neural network, which then branches out to the four task-specific heads.
