Three-tower Architecture:

Left tower - 用户塔 (User Tower, very large):
- Input: 用户特征 场景特征 (User Features + Context Features) - blue and orange features
- Output: blue vector

Middle tower - 物品塔 (Item Tower, relatively large):
- Input: 物品特征 (静态) (Item Features - static) - red features
- Output: red vector

Right tower - 交叉塔 (Cross Tower, relatively small):
- Input: 统计特征、交叉特征 (Statistical Features, Cross Features) - green features  
- Output: green vector

The three towers operate independently and process different types of features with different computational complexities.
