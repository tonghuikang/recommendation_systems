交叉层 (Cross Layer)

[DIAGRAM: Cross layer with residual connection showing:
- Input: x₀ (red vector) flows through ⋯ to xᵢ (purple vector)
- xᵢ goes to "全连接层" (Fully Connected Layer)
- Output y (green vector)
- Hadamard Product operation
- z (blue vector)
- Residual connection with + operation
- Final output: xᵢ₊₁ (purple vector)]
