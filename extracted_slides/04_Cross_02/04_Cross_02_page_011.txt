交叉层 (Cross Layer)

[MATHEMATICAL FORMULA showing cross layer computation:
xᵢ₊₁ = x₀ ∘ [W • xᵢ + b] + xᵢ

Where:
- xᵢ₊₁ (purple vector) = output
- x₀ (red vector) = input to cross layer  
- W (yellow matrix) = weight matrix
- xᵢ (purple vector) = current layer input
- b (yellow vector) = bias vector
- ∘ represents Hadamard product
- Final addition creates residual connection]
