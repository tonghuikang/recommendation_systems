Cross Network (交叉网络)

Extended architecture with two cross layers:
- Input: x₀ (red vector)
- First cross layer (交叉层) with parameters: W₀, b₀ → x₁
- Second cross layer (交叉层) with parameters: W₁, b₁ → x₂

Mathematical formula for second layer:
x₂ = x₀ ∘ (W₁x₁ + b₁) + x₁

The architecture shows the sequential application of cross layers, where each layer maintains a connection to the original input x₀ while also using the previous layer's output.
