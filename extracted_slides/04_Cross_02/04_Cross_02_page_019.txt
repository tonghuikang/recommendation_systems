Cross Network (交叉网络)

Full cross network architecture with three layers:
- Input: x₀ (red vector)
- First cross layer (交叉层) with parameters: W₀, b₀ → x₁
- Second cross layer (交叉层) with parameters: W₁, b₁ → x₂  
- Third cross layer (交叉层) with parameters: W₂, b₂ → x₃

The diagram illustrates the complete cross network structure where:
- Each cross layer takes the original input x₀ and the previous layer's output
- The network builds increasingly complex feature interactions layer by layer
- All layers maintain residual connections with both the original input and previous outputs
