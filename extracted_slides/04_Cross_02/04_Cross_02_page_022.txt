Deep & Cross Network (深度交叉网络)

Complete DCN architecture showing:

Left side input features:
- 用户特征 (User Features) - blue section
- 物品特征 (Item Features) - red section  
- 其它特征 (Other Features) - green section

Two parallel processing paths:
1. 全连接网络 (Fully Connected Network) → yellow output vector
2. 交叉网络 (Cross Network) → purple output vector

Final combination:
- The outputs from both networks are concatenated
- Fed into a 全连接层 (Fully Connected Layer)
- Produces final brown output vector

This architecture combines the memorization ability of cross networks with the generalization ability of deep networks.
