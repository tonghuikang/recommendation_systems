LHUC in Speech Recognition (语音识别中的LHUC)

Visual representation showing two input types:

1. 语音信号 (Speech Signal) - red vector/matrix representing audio input

2. 说话者的特征 (Speaker Features) - blue vector representing speaker characteristics

This illustrates the original application of LHUC in speech recognition where the model needs to adapt to both the speech signal content and speaker-specific characteristics.
