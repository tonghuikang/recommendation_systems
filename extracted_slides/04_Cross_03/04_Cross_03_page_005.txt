LHUC in Speech Recognition (语音识别中的LHUC)

Architecture showing:

Upper path (Speech Signal):
- 语音信号 (Speech Signal) - red vector
- → 全连接层 (Fully Connected Layer)
- → red output vector

Lower path (Speaker Features):  
- 说话者的特征 (Speaker Features) - blue vector
- → 神经网络 (Neural Network)
- → blue output vector

Note at bottom:
[多个全连接层] → [Sigmoid 乘以2]
(Multiple fully connected layers → Sigmoid times 2)

This shows how LHUC processes both speech content and speaker-specific information through separate pathways.
