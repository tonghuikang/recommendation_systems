LHUC in Speech Recognition (语音识别中的LHUC)

Architecture with Hadamard Product:

Upper path (Speech Signal):
- 语音信号 (Speech Signal) - red vector
- → 全连接层 (Fully Connected Layer)  
- → red output vector

Lower path (Speaker Features):
- 说话者的特征 (Speaker Features) - blue vector
- → 神经网络 (Neural Network)
- → blue output vector

Interaction:
- Hadamard Product (element-wise multiplication) ∘
- The blue vector modulates the red vector through element-wise multiplication
- Final result: modulated red vector

This demonstrates how speaker features can selectively amplify or suppress different aspects of the speech signal processing.
