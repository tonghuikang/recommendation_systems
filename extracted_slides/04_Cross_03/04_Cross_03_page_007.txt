LHUC in Speech Recognition (语音识别中的LHUC)

Extended architecture with multiple layers:

Upper path (Speech Signal):
- 语音信号 (Speech Signal) - red vector
- → 全连接层 (Fully Connected Layer) → red vector
- → Hadamard Product ∘ (modulated by speaker features)
- → 全连接层 (Fully Connected Layer) → final red output

Lower path (Speaker Features):
- 说话者的特征 (Speaker Features) - blue vector  
- → 神经网络 (Neural Network) → blue vector
- → Additional pathway to second layer
- → 神经网络 (Neural Network) → final blue output

This shows how speaker features can influence multiple layers of speech processing, allowing for more sophisticated adaptation to different speakers throughout the network.
