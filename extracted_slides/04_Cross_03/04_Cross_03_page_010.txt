LHUC in Speech Recognition (语音识别中的LHUC)

Generalized LHUC architecture overview:

Shows pink vectors representing multiple layers/stages with:
- 神经网络 (Neural Network) components at bottom left and right

The diagram illustrates the general concept with:
[多个全连接层] → [Sigmoid 乘以2]
(Multiple fully connected layers → Sigmoid times 2)

This represents the abstract architecture of LHUC where multiple neural network stages can be modulated through the learned gating mechanism.
