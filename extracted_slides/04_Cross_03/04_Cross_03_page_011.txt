LHUC in Speech Recognition (语音识别中的LHUC)

Standard LHUC architecture without specific highlighting:

Upper path (Speech Signal):
- 语音信号 (Speech Signal) - red vector
- → 全连接层 (Fully Connected Layer) → red vector
- → Hadamard Product ∘ (first modulation)
- → 全连接层 (Fully Connected Layer) → red vector  
- → Hadamard Product ∘ (second modulation)
- → final red output

Lower path (Speaker Features):
- 说话者的特征 (Speaker Features) - blue vector
- → 神经网络 (Neural Network) → blue vector (feeds first Hadamard Product)
- → Additional pathway
- → 神经网络 (Neural Network) → blue vector (feeds second Hadamard Product)

This represents the standard LHUC architecture for speech recognition with multiple adaptation points.
