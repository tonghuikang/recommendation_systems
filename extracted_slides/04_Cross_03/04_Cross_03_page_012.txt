LHUC in Recommendation Ranking Models (推荐系统排序模型中的LHUC)

LHUC applied to recommendation systems:

Upper path (Item Features):
- 物品特征 (Item Features) - red vector
- → 全连接层 (Fully Connected Layer) → red vector
- → Hadamard Product ∘ (first modulation)
- → 全连接层 (Fully Connected Layer) → red vector  
- → Hadamard Product ∘ (second modulation)
- → final red output

Lower path (User Features):
- 用户特征 (User Features) - blue vector
- → 神经网络 (Neural Network) → blue vector (feeds first Hadamard Product)
- → Additional pathway
- → 神经网络 (Neural Network) → blue vector (feeds second Hadamard Product)

This shows how LHUC is adapted for recommendation systems, where user features modulate the processing of item features, enabling personalized item representation learning.
