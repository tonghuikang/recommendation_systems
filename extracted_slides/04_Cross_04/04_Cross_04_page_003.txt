Embedding layer showing feature transformation:

Input features (red dots):
- 用户 ID (User ID)
- 物品 ID (Item ID) 
- 物品类目 (Item Category)
- ⋮ (more features)
- 物品关键词 (Item Keywords)

Each input feature is transformed through embedding into blue vector representations:
- Multiple blue embedding vectors shown on the right
- Each embedding vector represents the learned dense representation of the corresponding categorical feature

This demonstrates the standard embedding process where categorical features are mapped to dense vector representations.
