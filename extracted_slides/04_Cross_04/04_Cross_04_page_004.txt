Embedding output representation:

Shows the result of the embedding process:
- Multiple blue embedding vectors arranged vertically
- Each vector represents a dense embedding of a categorical feature
- Dots (â‹®) indicate there are more embedding vectors
- All embeddings have the same dimensionality (shown as equal-width vectors)

This represents the concatenated or stacked embedding vectors that serve as input to subsequent neural network layers.
