Embedding vectors representation:

Shows the embedded feature vectors arranged as a matrix:
- m√ók matrix where:
  - m = number of features/fields
  - k = embedding dimension
- Multiple blue vectors stacked vertically
- Each vector represents an embedding of a categorical feature
- All embeddings have the same dimension k
