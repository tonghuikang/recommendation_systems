SENet

SENet with Highlighted Important Field:

1. Input: m×k embedding matrix (blue vectors with one darker blue vector highlighted)
2. Squeeze-and-Excitation process: AvgPool → FC+ReLU → FC+Sigmoid
3. Output: m×k re-weighted embeddings (pink vectors with one darker pink vector)

The darker colored vectors (both input and output) represent a field that receives higher attention weight, demonstrating how SENet can learn to emphasize more important features while de-emphasizing less relevant ones.

This illustrates the adaptive field weighting capability of SENet.
