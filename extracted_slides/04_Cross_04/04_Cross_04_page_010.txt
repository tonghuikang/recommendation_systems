SENet

Field-wise Weighting Explanation:

• SENet 对离散特征做 field-wise 加权。
(SENet performs field-wise weighting on discrete features.)

• Field:
  • 用户 ID Embedding 是 64 维向量。
  (User ID Embedding is a 64-dimensional vector.)
  • 64 个元素算一个 field，获得相同的权重。
  (64 elements count as one field and get the same weight.)

• 如果有 m 个 fields，那么权重向量是 m 维。
(If there are m fields, then the weight vector is m-dimensional.)

This explains how SENet treats each embedding vector as a single field and assigns one weight to all dimensions within that field.
