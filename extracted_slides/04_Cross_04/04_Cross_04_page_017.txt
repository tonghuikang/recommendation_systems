Summary (小结)

1. SENet 对离散特征做 field-wise 加权。
(SENet performs field-wise weighting on discrete features.)

2. Field 间特征交叉：
(Inter-field feature interactions:)

• 向量内积
(Vector inner product)

• 哈达玛乘积  
(Hadamard product)

• Bilinear cross

This summarizes the key concepts covered in the presentation about SENet and bilinear cross methods for cross-domain recommendation systems.
