FiBiNet Architecture Overview

Input processing flow:

1. 离散特征 (Discrete Features) - red dots
   ↓
2. Embedding layer
   ↓  
3. Blue embedding vectors (multiple vectors shown)
   ↓
4. Two parallel paths:
   - Top path: Concatenate → Blue concatenated vector
   - Bottom path: Bilinear processing → Cyan interaction vectors

This shows the basic architecture where discrete features are embedded and then processed through both concatenation and bilinear interaction paths to capture different types of feature relationships.
