FiBiNet Architecture with SENet

Input processing flow:

1. 离散特征 (Discrete Features) - red dots
   ↓
2. Embedding layer  
   ↓
3. Blue embedding vectors
   ↓
4. Two parallel paths:
   - Top path: Concatenate → Blue concatenated vector
   - Bottom path with SENet: 
     * SENet processing on embeddings → Pink re-weighted vectors
     * Bilinear processing → Purple interaction vectors (highlighted in red box)

This enhanced architecture incorporates SENet to learn field importance weights before applying bilinear interactions, combining both feature importance and feature interaction learning.
