Complete FiBiNet Architecture

Full processing pipeline:

1. 离散特征 (Discrete Features) - red dots
   ↓
2. Embedding layer
   ↓
3. Multiple processing paths (highlighted in red box):
   - Original embeddings → Bilinear → Cyan vectors
   - SENet-weighted embeddings → Bilinear → Purple vectors
   ↓
4. Feature combination:
   - Top: Original concatenated embeddings → Blue vector
   - Middle: 连续特征 (Continuous Features) → Yellow vector
   ↓
5. Final concatenation → 上层网络 (Upper Network)

This complete architecture combines:
- Original embeddings and their bilinear interactions
- SENet-weighted embeddings and their bilinear interactions  
- Continuous features
- All features are concatenated and fed to upper layers for final prediction
