[Architecture diagram showing multiple LastN features:]

Three parallel branches:
1. 点击的LastN (Clicked LastN) - Red vectors and video icons
2. 点赞的LastN (Liked LastN) - Green vectors and video icons  
3. 收藏的LastN (Favorited LastN) - Blue vectors and video icons

Each branch shows:
- Top: Average pooling (平均)
- Middle: Multiple embeddings with "..." indicating continuation
- Bottom: Video/media icons representing user interactions
- "Embedding" labeled on the side

All three branches are enclosed in red boxes, indicating they are used together as features.
