DIN Attention Mechanism

[Diagram showing:]

LastN向量: (LastN Vectors)
- Four red vectors labeled x₁, x₂, x₃, ..., xₙ

候选物品向量: (Candidate Item Vector)
- One blue vector labeled q

The diagram shows the relationship between user's LastN item vectors and the candidate item vector for computing attention weights.
