DIN Attention Mechanism - Step 1

[Diagram showing:]

相似度: (Similarity)
- Purple circle labeled α₁ with arrow pointing to it

LastN向量: (LastN Vectors)
- Four red vectors labeled x₁, x₂, x₃, ..., xₙ

候选物品向量: (Candidate Item Vector)
- One blue vector labeled q

Shows the computation of similarity α₁ between the first LastN vector x₁ and candidate item vector q.
