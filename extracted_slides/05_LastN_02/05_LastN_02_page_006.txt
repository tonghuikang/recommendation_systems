DIN Attention Mechanism - Step 2

[Diagram showing:]

相似度: (Similarity)
- Two purple circles labeled α₁, α₂ with arrows pointing to them

LastN向量: (LastN Vectors)
- Four red vectors labeled x₁, x₂, x₃, ..., xₙ

候选物品向量: (Candidate Item Vector)
- One blue vector labeled q

Shows the computation of similarities α₁ and α₂ between the first two LastN vectors and candidate item vector q.
