DIN Attention Mechanism - Step 3

[Diagram showing:]

相似度: (Similarity)
- Three purple circles labeled α₁, α₂, α₃ with arrows pointing to them

LastN向量: (LastN Vectors)
- Four red vectors labeled x₁, x₂, x₃, ..., xₙ

候选物品向量: (Candidate Item Vector)
- One blue vector labeled q

Shows the computation of similarities α₁, α₂, and α₃ between the first three LastN vectors and candidate item vector q.
