DIN Attention Mechanism - Complete

[Diagram showing:]

相似度: (Similarity)
- Four purple circles labeled α₁, α₂, α₃, ..., αₙ with arrows pointing to them

LastN向量: (LastN Vectors)
- Four red vectors labeled x₁, x₂, x₃, ..., xₙ

候选物品向量: (Candidate Item Vector)
- One blue vector labeled q

Shows the computation of all similarities α₁ through αₙ between all LastN vectors and the candidate item vector q.
