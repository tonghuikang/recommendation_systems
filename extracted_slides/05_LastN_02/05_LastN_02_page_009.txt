DIN Weighted Sum

[Diagram showing:]

Final weighted sum output:
- Purple vector at top labeled "加权和" (Weighted Sum)
- Arrows pointing up from similarity scores

相似度: (Similarity)
- Four gray boxes containing purple circles labeled α₁, α₂, α₃, ..., αₙ
- Each box shows multiplication operation (×)

LastN向量: (LastN Vectors)
- Four red vectors labeled x₁, x₂, x₃, ..., xₙ

候选物品向量: (Candidate Item Vector)
- One blue vector labeled q

Shows how the similarity scores are used as weights to compute the final weighted sum of LastN vectors.
