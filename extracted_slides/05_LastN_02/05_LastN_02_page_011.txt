DIN的本质是注意力机制

[Diagram showing attention mechanism:]

Left side (红色虚线框):
- Four red vectors labeled x₁, x₂, x₃, xₙ
- Text: "作为 key 和 value" (As key and value)

Right side (红色虚线框):
- One blue vector labeled q  
- Text: "作为 query" (As query)

This illustrates that DIN essentially implements an attention mechanism where LastN item vectors serve as both keys and values, while the candidate item vector serves as the query.
