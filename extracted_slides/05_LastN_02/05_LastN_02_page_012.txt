DIN的本质是注意力机制

[Architecture diagram showing:]

Top: Purple vector (output from attention layer)
↑
Middle: "单头注意力层" (Single-head Attention Layer) - gray box

Input arrows pointing up from:

Left side (红色虚线框):
- Four red vectors labeled x₁, x₂, x₃, xₙ  
- Text: "作为 key 和 value" (As key and value)

Right side (红色虚线框):
- One blue vector labeled q
- Text: "作为 query" (As query)

This shows the complete attention mechanism architecture where the single-head attention layer processes the keys/values and query to produce the final output vector.
