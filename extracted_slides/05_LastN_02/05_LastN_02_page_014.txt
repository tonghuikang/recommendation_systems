DIN有效的原因

[2D scatter plot diagram - same layout as previous slide]

Vertical axis: Arrow pointing up
Horizontal axis: Arrow pointing right

Categories plotted:
- 美妆 (Beauty): Light pink triangles (faded) in upper left quadrant
- 美食 (Food): Red circles in upper right quadrant  
- 汽车 (Cars): Light orange squares (faded) in lower left quadrant

Special markers:
- 加权平均 (Weighted Average): Purple star positioned closer to food category
- Text label: "作为用户特征" (As User Feature) in gray box

This slide shows how the weighted average (attention mechanism) produces a user feature vector that is positioned closer to the relevant category (food) compared to simple averaging, demonstrating the effectiveness of the DIN approach.
