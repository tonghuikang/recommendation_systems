[Note: This appears to be a title slide for a presentation on Cold Start problems in recommendation systems, specifically focusing on simple recall pathways. The slide is in Chinese and includes the author's name and contact information. There is also a red logo for "小红书" (Xiaohongshu/Little Red Book) in the bottom right corner.]
