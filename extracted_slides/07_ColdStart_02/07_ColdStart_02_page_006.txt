Challenges in Cold Start Callback

ItemCF is not suitable for item cold start

[The image shows a diagram illustrating the cold start problem for items in recommendation systems. There are two items represented by red and green video icons at the top, with arrows pointing down to six different user icons at the bottom. The diagram demonstrates how ItemCF (Item-based Collaborative Filtering) faces challenges when trying to recommend new items (cold start items) because these items don't have sufficient interaction history to establish collaborative relationships with existing items.]
