Two-Tower Model

[The image shows a two-tower architecture diagram]

Left Tower (a - User Tower):
- User ID, discrete features, continuous features
- Feature transformation
- Neural network
- Generates user embedding vector 'a' (shown in blue)

Right Tower (b - Item Tower):
- Item ID, discrete features, continuous features (highlighted in blue box)
- Feature transformation  
- Neural network
- Generates item embedding vector 'b' (shown in red)

Both towers feed into a cosine similarity calculation at the top, which outputs the final similarity score.
