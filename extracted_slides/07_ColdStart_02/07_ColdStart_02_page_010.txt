ID Embedding

Improvement Plan 1: New items use default embedding.

• When training item ID embeddings, let all new items share one ID instead of using their real IDs.

• Default embedding: The embedding vector corresponding to the shared ID.

• When the model is trained next time, new items will have their own ID embedding vectors.
