Basic Idea

• If a user likes one item, then he will also like items with similar content.

• First train a neural network based on item categories and image/text content, mapping items to vectors.

• Cluster item vectors into 1000 clusters and record the center direction of each cluster. (k-means clustering, using cosine similarity.)
