Extract Image and Text Features

[The image shows the same two-part feature extraction process as before, but with additional details:]

Top: Image feature extraction
- Input: Shiba Inu image with Chinese text
- Process: CNN → concatenation → Fully Connected Layer → Item's feature vector

Bottom: Text feature extraction  
- Input: Chinese text content
- Process: BERT → concatenation → Fully Connected Layer → Item's feature vector

Both image and text features are concatenated and passed through a fully connected layer to produce the final item feature vector.
