Content Similarity Between Two Items

[The image shows a symmetric architecture for comparing two items:]

Left side (Item a):
- Image → CNN → Fully Connected Layer → Feature vector a (blue)
- Text → BERT → Fully Connected Layer → Feature vector a (blue)

Right side (Item b):
- Image → CNN → Fully Connected Layer → Feature vector b (red)
- Text → BERT → Fully Connected Layer → Feature vector b (red)

Both feature vectors are generated using the same neural network architecture but with different input content.
