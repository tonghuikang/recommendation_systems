# Improving Dual Tower Models

## 改进双塔模型 (Improving Dual Tower Models)

### Model Architecture Overview
The slide shows a dual tower model architecture with:

#### Multi-Task Learning:
- **Top layer metrics**: 点击率 (Click Rate), 点赞率 (Like Rate), 收藏率 (Save Rate), 完播率 (Completion Rate)
- These multiple objectives are combined and fed back into the system

#### Tower Structure:
- **Left Tower (用户塔)**: User Tower
  - Fed by 用户特征 (User Features)
  - Represented by a sequence of colored embedding blocks

- **Right Tower (物品塔)**: Item Tower  
  - Fed by 物品特征 (Item Features)
  - Represented by a sequence of colored embedding blocks

#### Key Improvement Strategy:
The slide highlights **点赞率 (Like Rate)** with a red box, indicating this is a focus metric for optimization.

#### Technical Architecture:
- The dual tower architecture allows for independent encoding of user and item representations
- Multiple behavioral signals (click, like, save, completion) are used for multi-task optimization
- The model learns to predict various engagement metrics simultaneously
- User and item embeddings are learned separately and then combined for final predictions

This approach enables better representation learning by leveraging multiple behavioral signals while maintaining computational efficiency through the dual tower design.
