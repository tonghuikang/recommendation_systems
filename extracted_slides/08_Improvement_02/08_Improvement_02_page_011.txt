# Improving Dual Tower Models - Training Methods

## 改进双塔模型 (Improving Dual Tower Models)

### 方向3：改进模型的训练方法 (Direction 3: Improving Model Training Methods)

#### Training Method Improvements:

**• Baseline：做二分类，让模型学会区分正样本和负样本。**
- **Baseline**: Binary classification approach
- Model learns to distinguish between positive and negative samples
- Traditional approach using simple positive/negative sample pairs

**• 改进：结合二分类、batch 内负采样。（对于 batch 内负采样，需要做纠偏。）**
- **Improvement**: Combine binary classification with in-batch negative sampling
- Requires bias correction for in-batch negative sampling
- More sophisticated sampling strategy within training batches

**• 改进：使用自监督学习方法，让冷门物品的 embedding 学得更好。**
- **Improvement**: Use self-supervised learning methods
- Enables better embedding learning for cold/unpopular items
- Addresses the long-tail problem in recommendation systems

#### Key Training Enhancements:
1. **Advanced Negative Sampling**: In-batch negative sampling with bias correction
2. **Self-Supervised Learning**: Better representations for rare items
3. **Multi-Modal Training**: Combines different learning paradigms
4. **Cold Item Optimization**: Specific focus on improving embeddings for less popular content

#### Technical Benefits:
- Better sample efficiency during training
- Improved handling of data imbalance
- Enhanced representation quality for tail items
- More robust model performance across different item popularity ranges

These training improvements address key challenges in recommendation systems, particularly around sample selection and representation learning for diverse item catalogs.
