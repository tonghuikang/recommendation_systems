# Item-to-Item (I2I) Recommendation

## Introduction to I2I Systems

### Core Concept:
**Item-to-Item (I2I)** is a fundamental recommendation model class based on similar item recall.

This slide introduces the basic concept of Item-to-Item collaborative filtering, which forms the foundation for many recommendation systems. I2I systems focus on finding and recommending items that are similar to items a user has already interacted with.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Similarity-Based**: Relies on computing similarities between items
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses collective user behavior patterns
- **Scalable**: Can handle large item catalogs efficiently
- **Interpretable**: Easy to explain recommendations to users

### Application Context:
I2I models are widely used in various recommendation scenarios including:
- E-commerce product recommendations
- Content recommendations (articles, videos, music)
- Similar item suggestions
- Cross-selling and upselling strategies

The slide sets up the foundation for more detailed discussion of I2I implementation methods and variations that will follow in subsequent slides.
