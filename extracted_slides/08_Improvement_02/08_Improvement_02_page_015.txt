# Item-to-Item (I2I) - Extended Similarity Methods

## Method 2: Vector-Based Similarity Calculation

### 方法2：基于物品向量表征，计算向量相似度
**Method 2: Based on item vector representations, calculate vector similarity**

#### Applicable Models:
**• (双塔模型、图神经网络均可计算物品向量表征。)**
- **Dual Tower Models**: Can compute item vector representations
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Can compute item vector representations  
- Both architectures enable vector-based similarity computation

### Comprehensive I2I Approach:
The slide introduces the second major method for calculating item similarity, expanding beyond collaborative filtering to include:

#### Vector-Based Similarity:
1. **Representation Learning**: Items are encoded into dense vector representations
2. **Similarity Computation**: Use vector similarity metrics (cosine, dot product, etc.)
3. **Deep Learning Integration**: Leverages neural network architectures

#### Architecture Compatibility:
- **Dual Tower Models**: Generate item embeddings through dedicated item tower
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Learn item representations through graph structure
- **Multi-Modal Learning**: Can incorporate various item features (text, images, metadata)

#### Advantages:
- **Semantic Similarity**: Captures deeper item relationships beyond co-occurrence
- **Cold Start Friendly**: Can handle new items with limited interaction data
- **Feature Rich**: Incorporates multiple types of item information
- **Scalable**: Efficient computation using vector operations

This method complements traditional collaborative filtering approaches by providing richer, more nuanced similarity calculations based on learned representations rather than just behavioral co-occurrence patterns.
