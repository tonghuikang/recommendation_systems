# Recall Models Summary

## 小众的召回模型 (Niche Recall Models)

This slide serves as a section header introducing specialized or less common recall models used in recommendation systems.

### Context:
After covering the main I2I (Item-to-Item) approaches, this section will likely explore:

#### Potential Niche Models:
- **Specialized Collaborative Filtering**: Advanced variants beyond basic CF
- **Content-Based Methods**: Using item attributes and metadata
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining multiple recommendation strategies
- **Domain-Specific Models**: Tailored for specific verticals or use cases
- **Experimental Techniques**: Newer or research-oriented methods

#### Why Niche Models Matter:
1. **Coverage Enhancement**: Fill gaps left by mainstream methods
2. **Specialized Use Cases**: Address specific domain requirements
3. **Diversity Improvement**: Provide varied recommendation sources
4. **Performance Optimization**: Excel in particular scenarios
5. **Innovation Pipeline**: Test new approaches before mainstream adoption

#### Integration Strategy:
- Often used alongside primary recall methods
- Allocated smaller traffic percentages for testing
- Focused on specific user segments or item categories
- Part of ensemble recommendation systems

This introduction sets up the discussion of alternative and specialized recall methods that complement the primary I2I and collaborative filtering approaches in a comprehensive recommendation system.
