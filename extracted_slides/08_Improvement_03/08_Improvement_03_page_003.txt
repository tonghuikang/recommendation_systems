### Presentation Structure:
This outline covers a comprehensive approach to ranking model improvements in recommendation systems:

#### Core Components:
- **Two-Stage Ranking**: Both coarse and fine ranking optimizations
- **Sequential Modeling**: Understanding user behavior patterns over time
- **Adaptive Learning**: Real-time model improvements
- **Ensemble Strategies**: Combining multiple model approaches

#### Focus Areas:
The presentation will systematically cover improvements across the entire ranking pipeline, from initial filtering through final item ordering, incorporating both static improvements and dynamic learning capabilities.

This structure suggests a thorough exploration of ranking model enhancements with practical implementation considerations for large-scale recommendation systems.
