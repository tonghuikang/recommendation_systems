- **Performance Critical**: Directly impacts user engagement metrics

#### Expected Improvements:
The following slides will likely cover:

1. **Advanced Neural Architectures**: 
   - Deep learning models for ranking
   - Attention mechanisms and transformers
   - Multi-task learning approaches

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Cross-feature interactions
   - Embedding techniques
   - Feature selection strategies

3. **Training Methodologies**:
   - Loss function optimization
   - Regularization techniques
   - Online learning adaptations

4. **Multi-Objective Optimization**:
   - Balancing different engagement metrics
   - Trade-offs between accuracy and diversity
   - Long-term value optimization

This section focuses on the most sophisticated ranking stage where computational resources can be allocated for maximum model complexity and prediction accuracy.
