# Multi-Task Fine Ranking Architecture

## Neural Network Architecture for Fine Ranking

### Architecture Components:

#### Multi-Task Prediction Heads:
- **预估点击率 (Click Rate Prediction)**: CTR estimation
- **预估点赞率 (Like Rate Prediction)**: Engagement prediction  
- **预估转发率 (Share Rate Prediction)**: Viral potential estimation
- **预估评论率 (Comment Rate Prediction)**: Discussion engagement

#### Network Structure:
- **全连接网络 (Fully Connected Network)**: Dense layers for feature interaction
- **Concatenation Layer**: Feature fusion across different modalities
- **Embedding Layers**: Dense representations for categorical features

#### Feature Types:
- **离散特征 (Discrete Features)**: Categorical variables (shown as green circles)
- **连续特征 (Continuous Features)**: Numerical variables (shown as blue rectangles)

### Technical Architecture:
1. **Feature Processing**: 
   - Discrete features → Embedding layers
   - Continuous features → Direct input
   
2. **Feature Combination**:
   - Embedding + Fully Connected Network processing for discrete features
   - Direct fully connected processing for continuous features
   
3. **Multi-Task Learning**:
   - Shared representation learning
   - Task-specific prediction heads
   - Joint optimization across multiple objectives

### Key Benefits:
- **Shared Learning**: Common patterns across different engagement types
- **Task Regularization**: Prevents overfitting to single metrics
- **Efficient Architecture**: Shared computation for multiple predictions
- **Production Ready**: Scalable for real-time inference

This architecture enables simultaneous optimization for multiple engagement metrics while sharing computational resources and learned representations.
