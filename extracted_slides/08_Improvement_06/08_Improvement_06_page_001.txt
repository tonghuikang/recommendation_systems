### Focus Area: Multi-Modal Interaction Behavior Analysis

This presentation focuses on methods to improve recommendation system performance by effectively leveraging various types of user interaction behaviors beyond basic clicks and views.

### Key Interaction Behaviors:

#### Primary Interaction Types:
1. **关注 (Follow/Subscribe)**:
   - Strong positive signal indicating user interest
   - Long-term engagement indicator
   - Creator-user relationship establishment

2. **转发 (Share/Retweet)**:
   - High-value engagement indicating content resonance
   - Social amplification behavior
   - Quality and relevance signal

3. **评论 (Comment)**:
   - Deep engagement with content
   - Opinion and sentiment expression
   - Community participation indicator

### Technical Implementation Strategies:

#### Multi-Signal Integration:
- **Weighted Feedback**: Different interaction types with varying importance weights
- **Implicit vs Explicit Signals**: Balancing direct actions with inferred preferences
- **Temporal Patterns**: Understanding interaction timing and frequency
- **Cross-Platform Behavior**: Integrating behaviors across different interfaces

#### Advanced Modeling Approaches:
- **Multi-Task Learning**: Simultaneous prediction of different interaction types
- **Behavioral Sequence Modeling**: Understanding interaction progression patterns
- **Social Signal Processing**: Leveraging network effects and viral behaviors
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Extracting emotional context from comments and shares

#### Business Applications:
- **Content Quality Assessment**: Using engagement depth as quality indicators
- **Creator Recommendation**: Suggesting users to follow based on interaction patterns  
- **Viral Content Prediction**: Identifying content likely to be shared
- **Community Building**: Fostering discussion and interaction through recommendations

This comprehensive approach to interaction behavior analysis enables more nuanced and effective recommendation systems that understand the full spectrum of user engagement.
